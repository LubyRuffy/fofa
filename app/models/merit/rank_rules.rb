# 5 stars is a common ranking use case. They are not given at specified
# actions like badges, you should define a cron job to test if ranks are to be
# granted.

# +set_rank+ accepts:
# * :+level+ ranking level (greater is better)
# * :+to+ model or scope to check if new rankings apply
# * :+level_name+ attribute name (default is empty and results in 'level'
#   attribute, if set it's appended like 'level_#{level_name}')
